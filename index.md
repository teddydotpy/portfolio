## I'm still learning.

   I am a person who has an unrelenting love for knowledge. I am
   fascinated in learning as much as I can and using that knowledge and
   experience to try and do the best I can in all the projects I
   undertake. I am open to new insights and opportunities. The domain of
   problems that I would like to work with ranges from complexity theory
   to game engine design to Data Science. I am working on it, and I am
   still learning.
