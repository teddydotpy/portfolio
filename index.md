<h1> I'm still learning. </h1>

    <p>
      I am a person who has an unrelenting love for knowledge. I am fascinated in learning as much as I can and using that knowledge and experience to try and do the best I can in all the projects I undertake. I am open to new insights and opportunities. The domain of problems that I would like to work with ranges from complexity theory to game engine design to Data Science. I am working on it, and I am still learning.
